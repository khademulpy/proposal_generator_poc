Repeat test for each zone that applies. d. Perform operating checks of all signals sent to monitoring facilities and interlocks with smoke control and HVAC systems during all modes of operation of the fire suppression systems. 9. The CxA shall inspect and verify the position of each device and interlock identified in the test procedure. Each item shall be signed off as acceptable (yes) or failed (no). 10. During CxA-witnessed functional testing, the CxA will document results of the test on the functional performance test forms. LSHS BUILDING 1 BOILER PLANT UPGRADE 230800 Lake Stevens School District No. 4 MECHANICAL SYSTEMS COMMISSIONING Hargis Engineers, 121-24060 Page 11 11. If during the test an operating deficiency is observed, appropriate comments will be added to the test procedure form and the issue log. 12.

The Contractor shall reschedule the test and the test is repeated until satisfactory performance is achieved. 4. Cost of retesting a performance test shall be paid by the Contractor. 5. The Contractor shall submit in writing to the Owner and CxA at least as often as commissioning meetings are being scheduled the status of each outstanding discrepancy identified during commissioning. Discussion shall cover explanations of any disagreement and proposals for their resolutions. a. The CxA retains the original non-conformance forms until the end of the project. b. Retesting shall not be considered a justified reason for a claim of delay or for a time extension by the Contractor.
